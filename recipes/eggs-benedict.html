                <li>⅛ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 pinch ground white pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon hot water, or more as needed (optional)</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Eggs Benedict</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
                <li>8 eggs</li>
                <li>8 strips bacon</li>
                <li>4 English muffins, split</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the Hollandaise; whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of water, Worcestershire sauce and white pepper in the top of a bain-marie over simmering water. Add melted butter 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time, while whisking yolks constantly. If Hollandaise begins to get too thick add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all of the butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt then remove from heat. Place a lid on the pan to keep sauce warm.</li>
                <li>To poach the eggs; fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar and keep water at a gentle simmer. Crack an egg into a small bowl then gently slip egg into the simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of the water. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 ½ to 3 minutes. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water and place onto a warm plate.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat grill. Brown bacon under medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Toast English muffins under the grill.</li>
                <li>To serve eggs Benedict; spread toasted muffins with butter and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg. Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with Hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Enjoy</strong> :)</li>
