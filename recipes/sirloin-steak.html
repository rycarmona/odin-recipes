        <h2>How to cook a sirloin steak</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Cooking times (for 2cm thick)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blue:</strong> 1 min each side</li>
            <li><strong>Rare:</strong> 1½ mins per side</li>
            <li><strong>Medium rare:</strong> 2 mins per side</li>
            <li><strong>Medium:</strong> About 2¼ mins per side</li>
            <li><strong>Well-done:</strong> About 4-5 mins each side</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>(Optional) Salt your steak in advance – 2 hrs for every 1cm of thickness. This doesn't draw out the moisture, it gives the steak time to absorb the salt and become more evenly seasoned throughout.</li>
            <li>Bring the meat out of the fridge up to one hour before cooking so that it gets closer to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Season with pepper (and salt if ot previosuly) just before cooking.</li>
            <li>Heat a heavy-based frying pan until very hot but not smoking.</li>
            <li>Drizzle some (flavourless) oil into the pan and leave for a moment.</li>
            <li>Add the steak, a knob of butter, some garlic and robust herbs, if you want.</li>
            <li>Sear evenly on each side for our recommended time, turning every minute for the best caramelised crust.</li>
            <li>When you're happy, finish the steak off by rendering the fatty edge, holding the steak on its side between tongs for a couple of minutes. The fat will melt and add flavour.</li>
            <li>Leave to rest on a board or warm plate for about 5 mins.</li>
            <li>Serve the steak whole or carved into slices with the resting juices poured over.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy</strong> :)</li>
        </ol>
